\item{marker_names}{the name of the marker for each alignment to be appended at the end of the sequences names, in the same order as in the correspondence table}

\item{out}{specify outputs filename}

\item{format}{a string specifying in what formats you want the alignment. Can be "fasta", "phylip" and "nexus"}

\item{excel.sheet}{specify what sheet from the excel spreadsheet you wanna read. Either a string (the name of a sheet), or an integer (the position of the sheet).}
